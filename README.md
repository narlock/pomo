# Pomo

## Roadmap
- Release v1.0.0 which provides a simple terminal based interface for a pomodoro timer. Allowing for customization of the pomodoro timer including its settings. Feature to create, edit, and delete existing pomodoro settings. This release will include:
    1. Finished pomodoro application: creates the main menu, timer countdown, pomodoro logic, customizable settings, create/update/delete pomodoros, installation script.
    2. Website `pomo.narlock.dev` to highlight the release and provide a tutorial.
    3. YouTube video showcasing how I built the first version and demostration.
- Release v1.1.0 - focus on implementing features that show statistics. Expand on the ability to specifically track focus time and individual user sessions.
- Release v1.2.0 - After the terminal based implementation is complete, explore expanding to a full GUI system using PyQt for users that may want the same features as pomo, but their workflow isn't built for terminals.
