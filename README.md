Pomo is a fully customizable command-line Pomodoro timer designed for users who prefer a simple yet powerful productivity tool. Built for keyboard-driven workflows, Pomo runs entirely in the terminal, making it fast and accessible without ever leaving the keyboard.

If you find this project helpful or interesting, please consider giving it a ⭐ on GitHub. Your support is greatly appreciated!

## Roadmap
- Release v1.0.0 which provides a simple terminal based interface for a pomodoro timer. Allowing for customization of the pomodoro timer including its settings. Feature to create, edit, and delete existing pomodoro settings. This release will include:
    - ✅ ~~Finished pomodoro application: creates the main menu, timer countdown, pomodoro logic, customizable settings, create/update/delete pomodoros, installation script.~~
    - ~~Website `pomo.narlock.dev` to highlight the release and provide a tutorial.~~
    - YouTube video showcasing how I built the first version and demostration.
- Release v1.1.0 - focus on implementing features that show statistics. Expand on the ability to specifically track focus time and individual user sessions.
- Release v1.2.0 - After the terminal based implementation is complete, explore expanding to a full GUI system using PyQt for users that may want the same features as pomo, but their workflow isn't built for terminals.

## Contributing to Pomo
If you notice an issue with Pomo, please create an issue on GitHub for it. If you have a solution to the issue, please create a pull request and mention the issue. Likewise, if you find someone else opening an issue and you would like to build a solution for it, please do so! Just remember to mention the issue.

### Guidelines
- Follow the [PEP 8 style](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for writing your Python code.
- Create comment documentation for each new function that you implement / fix you make (if necessary).
- Prioritize readability and maintainability rather than being performance efficient.

Don't worry about getting the guidelines perfect. This is what the pull requests are for. I've probably messed up plenty on this too! 😃
